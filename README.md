# Exploring Mental Health Data - Solution

This solution is an implementation of the solution for the Kaggle Machine Learning competition "Exploring Mental Health Data". In this solution, the data is preprocessed and cleaned
before training it using the XGBoost Regressor model.

## Steps to run locally.

1. Go to the link https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e11/data and download the files `train.csv` and `test.csv`.
2. Add both the files to this repository.
3. Run `solution.py` and result should be available in a file called `result.csv`.
4. Upload the file `result.csv` to this link https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e11/data and find a button called 'Late Submission'.
5. You can play with the code logic to increase the accuracy.
